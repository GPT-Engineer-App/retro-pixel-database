# retro-pixel-database

The project is aimed at creating a detailed markdown file architecture for a multi-platform database template. The main features include pages dedicated to retro pixel-style video games, a league page for building draft simulations customized to specific sports, and a sports card trading page. The design should encapsulate a retro feel while incorporating an extremely modern UI, emphasizing the rebirth of classic baseball card trading. The platform should be highly user-friendly for both users and admins. The final phase involves integrating a Picture in Picture feature to plug users' custom ChatGPT models into the database for syncing and pulling information. The focus is on the front-end architecture, with backend development to be handled later.
